# Bubble Sort
A project for the Odin Project Ruby Course

### Assignment

Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).

> /> bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])  
> => [0,2,2,3,4,78]
